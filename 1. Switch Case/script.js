// WHEN TO USE SWITCH CASE?
// Switch case is normally used when you have pre-defined module or universally defined module. eg- a week=7days , a month =30 days or 4 weeks...these are universally defined module...it cannot be changed.

// And it is mostly used on integar value. It can be used on float or string , but it should be avoided.
